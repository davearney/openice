<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Thanks for trying OpenICE!
</p>
<p>
  This guide aims to introduce readers to medical device integration using the Open-source Integrated Clinical Environment (OpenICE). OpenICE is a distributed system platform for connecting network nodes together - e.g.:
  <ul>
    <li>medical devices found in an OR or ICU,</li>
    <li>blackbox recording applications (i.e. data logging),</li>
    <li>applications for clinical decision support (CDS),</li>
    <li>and external interfaces to other healthcare IT (HIT) systems like EMR flowsheets. </li>
  </ul>
  OpenICE automates peer-to-peer node discovery, data publishing and subscribing between nodes, as well as proprietary medical device protocol translation. Users and developers of the OpenICE platform get the data they need, in a common sensible format, seamlessly delivered to the destinations they want.
</p>
<p>
  OpenICE has been called an open clinical research platform, an abstraction layer for medical devices, a medical Internet of things (MIoT) platform, a cyber-physical system (CPS) test tool, an app hosting environment, amongst other names. The current version of OpenICE enables users to convert heterogeneous medical device data from supported devices into a common structure and protocol, and to exchange that data with demonstration clinical applications on a different machine (or machines). OpenICE includes several simple but useful sample applications as well as example code to help users to write their own.

    <p>
      The OpenICE application is the entry and exit point for medical device data into and out of the network. OpenICE has two operating modes: <b><a href="{{ site.url }}/docs/2_supervisor.html">Supervisor</a></b> and <b><a href="{{ site.url }}/docs/4_device-adapter-setup.html">Device-Adapter</a></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>Device-Adapter</b> software acts as a bridge that will to connect both real and simulated medical devices into the OpenICE network. The Device-Adapter software translates the proprietary device communication protocols into the standard OpenICE data structures (described in <a href="https://github.com/mdpnp/mdpnp/blob/master/data-types/x73-idl/src/main/idl/ice/ice.idl">ice.idl</a>) and communication protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>Supervisor</b> runs clinical applications and subscribes to all medical devices in the same <a href="#run">Domain</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}/docs/2_supervisor.html">Patient Context</a>.

<h3 id="download">Downloading and Installing</h3>
<p>
  The OpenICE device-adapter and supervisor are distributed as one JAR for your convenience. You can download the software <a href="https://github.com/mdpnp/mdpnp/releases/latest">by clicking here</a>. To view the different releases available, check the <a href="https://github.com/mdpnp/mdpnp/releases" target="_blank">files</a> section of github.

<h3 id="run">Running OpenICE Software from the GUI</h3>
<p>
  Launch OpenICE. When open, the OpenICE application presents a start menu GUI. This menu is used to configure the mode of operation of the OpenICE application.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">NOTE:
  If you would like to use the GUI to start both the Supervisor and a Device-Adapter(s), run the Supervisor first and start Device-Adapters from within the Supervisor.

        Choose which software mode to run the application as: <b>ICE Supervisor</b> or <b>ICE Device Interface</b> (same as device-adapter). The ICE_Supervisor hosts clinical applications. The ICE_Device_Interface connects a medical device to the OpenICE network.
