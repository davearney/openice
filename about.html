					Advancing the Adoption of Medical Device "Plug-and-Play" 
					Interoperability to Improve Patient Safety and Healthcare Efficiency 
					The absence of an intranet-like ecosystem for interconnecting medical devices and clinical information 
					systems is a fundamental impediment to realizing the national vision of using comprehensive, accurate, 
					electronic medical records and HIT systems to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare. 
					Interoperability of devices and IT systems in clinical environments will permit mixed-vendor 
					(“heterogeneous”) data transfer, comprehensive secure data acquisition, and safety-enhancing capabilities 
					such as safety interlocks and closed-loop device control. This functionality has been recognized by HITSP as 
					an important part of the roadmap for common device connectivity requirements (as part of the Common 
					Device Connectivity AHIC Extension/Gap, December 2008, and in TN 905 in January 2010). Medical device 
					interoperability will enable innovations to improve patient safety, treatment efficacy, and workflow 
					efficiency, reducing medical errors and healthcare costs to the benefit of patients throughout the 
					continuum of care – from the home, to out-of-hospital transport, and to clinical areas as diverse as the OR, 
					ICU, and general hospital ward. Moreover, this will facilitate regulatory and Meaningful Use compliance. 
					
					About the Medical Device “Plug-and-Play” (MD PnP) Interoperability Program 
					The MD PnP program, established in 2004, has become a recognized leader in the development of the 
					concepts and capabilities for integrated clinical environments of the future. We have been working to 
					accelerate the adoption of medical device interoperability by providing interoperability building blocks 
					(use cases, standards, a neutral lab environment, and open research tools) and by changing clinical and 
					market expectations of what can be achieved. 
					 
					The program is affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), CIMIT (Center for Integration of 
					Medicine and Innovative Technology), and Partners HealthCare System, with additional support from 
					TATRC (the U.S. Army Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center). Having evolved from the 
					OR of the Future program at MGH, the MD PnP program remains clinically grounded. We have taken a 
					multi-faceted approach to begin addressing key barriers to achieving interoperability, including the 
					development and support of suitable open standards (e.g. the ASTM F2761-09 Integrated Clinical 
					Environment, or ICE), and the elicitation, collection and modeling of clinical use cases and engineering 
					requirements for the ICE platform and “ecosystem”. 
					 
					Our interdisciplinary, multi-institutional program team collaborates with diverse stakeholders (clinicians, 
					biomedical and clinical engineers, academic engineering programs, healthcare delivery systems, 
					regulatory agencies, medical device vendors, standards development organizations). Since the 
					program’s inception, more than 800 clinical and engineering experts, and representatives of more than 
					100 companies and institutions have participated in plenary workshops/conferences, working group 
					meetings, and focus groups to help shape the common goals and contribute their expertise. 
					 
					The CIMIT MD PnP Lab provides a vendor-neutral “sandbox” to evaluate the ability of candidate 
					interoperability solutions to solve clinical problems, to model clinical use cases (in a simulation 
					environment), to develop and test related network safety and security systems, and to support 
					interoperability and standards conformance testing. 
					 
					Key MD PnP Program projects 
					Support for MD PnP program work has come from DoD/TATRC, NSF, NIST, CIMIT, and NIH/NIBIB, which 
					awarded a $10M Quantum grant in October 2010 to develop a healthcare intranet based on integrated 
					medical device systems. Program work to date has achieved significant milestones in several 
					interdependent and synergistic areas, pursued in parallel since 2004. 
					• Developing a new open standard for a patient-centric “Integrated Clinical Environment” (ICE) to 
					define the conditions under which interoperability can enable device integration to create new 
					medical device systems with greater safety and performance capabilities than any individual device –
					Part I of the ICE standard was published as ASTM F2761-09, and is providing a valuable framework for



					further defining the vision and clinical content for other standards (e.g. it was cited in HITSP Technical 
					Note 905) 
					• Defining a safe regulatory pathway for patient-centric 
					networked medical devices, in partnership with the FDA; 
					progress includes co-sponsoring a workshop held by FDA in 
					January 2010 on medical device interoperability, followed 
					by a working group of companies, academics, and hospitals 
					that have developed and submitted a pre-IDE regulatory 
					submission to help refine the FDA clearance process (see 
					FDA workshop content on our web site) 
					• Creating and refining interoperability contracting language 
					for use by hospitals in their procurement of medical 
					devices (MD FIRE: Medical Device Free Interoperability 
					Requirements for the Enterprise) – signed by the VA in 
					2012. 
					• Eliciting and analyzing clinical scenarios at the level of 
					detail needed to inform interoperability solutions and to 
					derive engineering requirements 
					• Performing detailed workflow analysis of these use cases with a team of MD PnP collaborators 
					(including multiple device companies) and analyzing the ability of existing standards (e.g. IEEE 11073) 
					to meet these requirements (gap analysis), yielding important understanding of the capabilities and 
					limitations of existing interface standards 
					• Developing demonstration implementations of clinical use cases in which integrating the clinical 
					environment will improve patient safety (e.g. x-ray/ventilator synchronization and safety interlocks 
					for patient-controlled analgesia medication delivery), and showing these at major clinical and health 
					IT conferences 
					 
					Through our Quantum grant, we are developing a prototype healthcare intranet with an open ICE 
					platform and tools to ensure safe and effective connectivity of medical equipment and decision support 
					for clinical care. This open prototype research platform could support evaluations by the FDA of 
					interoperable medical device systems and serve as a generic model that could be shared with other 
					organizations developing, for example, open device software adapters and an ICE Part I reference 
					architecture. 
					 
					How You Can Participate 
					• Clinicians can contribute clinical scenarios (or “use cases”) to ensure that new interoperability standards 
					and technologies will enable meaningful clinical solutions. Diversity of use cases increases the likelihood 
					of effective and generalizable solutions. 
					• Engineers can analyze clinical use cases to generate functional specifications, assess current standards to 
					perform “gap analyses”, and evaluate proposed technologies. Diverse engineering expertise is essential. 
					• Healthcare delivery organizations can specify performance requirements, and require adherence to 
					medical device interoperability language in vendor contracts, adopting the sample language now 
					available and continuing to refine it. Widespread adoption of interoperability will happen only when 
					there is recognized consumer demand. 
					• Regulatory agencies can facilitate regulatory clearance of interoperable medical devices, creating new 
					regulatory paradigms where needed. 
					• Medical device manufacturers can participate in the development and adoption of interoperability 
					standards, work with the FDA on the regulatory pathway, and partner with the MD PnP Program to 
					develop a shared interoperability testing and use case demonstration environment. 
					• Interoperability promoting organizations can support revision of existing standards to meet clinical 
					requirements, collaborate on clinical use case implementations in the MD PnP Lab, and ensure that 
					through collaboration we shepherd the adoption of medical device interoperability to empower 
					innovation in the safety and efficiency of health care. 
					 
					We are interested in collaborating with researchers who are working on medical device architecture, communication, network security, and health IT infrastructure.
