          <p>
              This guide will assist you in using and understanding the OpenICE Applications ("apps"). <a class="text-danger">Currently, all of these apps are experimental and are not used in clinical settings. </a> Once you start the ICE Supervisor, a list of apps will appear on the left side. To open the app, click on the image. To exit the app and go back to the ICE Supervisor, click the Exit App button. The OpenICE application will close you x out of an app. <!-- I know this seems trivial - but it kept happening to me so i think it's good to say something like this...  -->
          </p>
          <p>
              Before running an app, you should assign devices to a patient and select that patient. For instructions on connecting devices, please go to the <a href="./device-adapter-setup.html">Device Adapter Setup</a> and <a href="./user-docs.html">User Manual</a> page. On the bottom of the ICE Supervisor, click the dropdown to select a patient

          <h3 id="alarm-history">Alarm History</h3>
          <p>
              This app displays all of alarms that have gone off, from a specific device, over a certain amount of time. Once you open the app, two large boxes appear, the table on the left displays patient alarms and the table on the right displays technical alarms. The four column headings listed below are displayed (in both the patient alarms table and the technical alarms table) when running this app. You may sort the alarms by any of the headings by clicking on the heading itself. An arrow next to the heading will appear after clicking the title to show the direction that the data has been sorted (see image below for example). The length of each column may also be made longer or shorter by selecting the line in between each column and dragging it forwards or backwards. We believe that an app such as this one may help provide a better understanding of false and nuisance alarms through post hoc analysis.

          <h3 id="auto-validate">Auto Validate</h3>
          <p>
            This app displays and automatically validates vital sign data from at least one physiological monitor. The main display of this app contains histograms of vital signs data emitted from various monitors. The purpose of this app is to allow the user to view vital sign data emitted from different monitors and to validate the accuracy of this data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within each histogram, the following is displayed:
            <dl class="dl-horizontal">
              <dt>Sources</dt>
              <dd>The number of devices that the data is coming from. The sources are also displayed in a legend below each graph.</dd>
              <dt>N</dt>
              <dd class="text-danger">The number of data points used to make the histogram. For example, if the number is 30, then the last 30 data points are used from each source (or is it total?). Is this accurate because in the data points below it says 20 and in each histogram it's more than that? </dd>

          <h3 id="chart">Chart</h3>
          <p>
            This app uses line graphs to display vital signs data from various monitors. Each vital sign has one graph, and each graph may have several data points if the data is emitted from more than one monitor or device. If this is the case, each data point (or line) will be a different color, and a legend below the graph will state where the data is coming from. This data is displayed over a predetermined amount of time. This app allows the user to see the potential variability in vital signs data that comes from different monitors or devices.

          <h3 id="data-visualization">Data Visualization</h3>
          <p>
            This app displays selected vital signs for one patient in the form of a shape. This allows the user to clearly see all vital signs and whether or not they are in the predetermined normal range.  If three vital signs are selected (typically the default) then a triangle will appear (see Examples 1-3 below). If four vital signs are selected, then a square will appear (see Example 4). To add or delete a vital sign from the data visualization app, this vital sign must be added or deleted from the <a href="#infusion-safety">Infusion Safety</a> app (see this section for details).
          </p>
          <p>
            Each leg of the triangle will represent a different vital sign, and each line has markings with numeric values. The ends of the lines contain numbers outside of the normal range (for example: SpO2 greater than 100 or less than 95), and the middle of the lines contain numbers within the normal range (for example: SpO2 between 95 and 100).
          </p>
          <p>
            The values that come from devices or physiological monitors are plotted on each line and are connected to one another, creating an inner shape. If there are more than two values for one vital sign, only the highest and the lowest values can be seen. This inner shape is colored based on the status of the vital sign data. To edit the values for when the inner shape will be green, yellow, or red, go to the <a href="#infusion-safety">Infusion Safety</a> app section for more information.

         <h3 id="patient-id">Patient ID</h3>
          <p>
            This application helps manage patients, devices and monitors. Specifically, patients may be connected to a device, and that patient may be selected while using other apps (and the devices selected in this app will be used). Patients can be connected to devices by selecting “Create an ICE Device Adapter”. Once a device is added it will automatically connect to the first name listed in the dropdown of patients listed at the bottom of the screen. To change the patient, click on the dropdown arrow before selecting the Create an ICE Device Adapter button. To disconnect the patient from the device in the application, click the button in the disconnect column. Once this has been done, the device will move to the box on the bottom right side of the page. To connect this device to another patient, click on a patient in the bottom left box and click on a device (both should be highlighted after they have been selected).  Then press the button in between these two boxes. 
          </p>
          <p>
            To add a new patient to use in the OpenICE apps, click the button “Create new MRN entry”. A window will pop up to add a new patient. This window will give the following fields:
          <dl class="dl-horizontal">
            <dt>MRN</dt>
            <dd>A medical record number is a unique identifier for each patient. This app will automatically create one. The MRN may be changed if desired.</dd>
            <dt>First Name</dt>
            <dd>Type in a first name.</dd>
            <dt>Last Name</dt>
            <dd>Type in a last name.</dd>
            <dt>Gender</dt>
            <dd>Select male or female dropdown list.</dd>
            <dt>DOB</dt>
            <dd>Type in a date of birth or click the icon to select a date from the calendar</dd>
          </dl>
            All edits made while the app was running will be saved once the app is closed.

          <h3 id="rr-calc">Respiratory Rate Calculator</h3>
          <p>
            This is app creates new values for vital sign using connected devices/ monitors for one specific patient. Click on a device on the top left of the screen and a waveform will appear below it. A numeric value may also appear to the right of the waveform. On the right side of the screen there is a bar with a button. The button can be moved to any value in between 0 to 100.  There is also an option to create a device. Check this box to ensure that the app will receive recent data.

          <h3 id="simulation-control">Simulation Control</h3>
          <p>
            This app allows changes to be to the vital signs data coming from simulated devices. To adjust the data value for a specific vital sign, scroll the button up and down the bar for the specific vital sign. A number will appear that states where the button has stopped on to the right of the bar. The vital sign will not remain on that single value, as jitter can be adjusted. Click the jitter checkbox to the right of the vital sign, then edit the step% and max%. To have the same jitter for all vital signs click the checkbox on the top of the screen next to “Jitter:Strength:0”. 
           <dl class="dl-horizontal">
            <dt>Jitter</dt>
            <dd class="text-danger">Allows the data point to fluctuate. Editing jitter also allows edits to be made to the step% and max%.</dd>
            <dt>Step%</dt>
