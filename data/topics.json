Multiple sensors may exist for the same metric so the instance_id serves to distinguish between them.  If a timestamp is available from the device's internal clock it is specified as device_time.  A device ought to register an instance of Numeric when the associated sensor might provide observations.  If the sensor is physically disconnected or otherwise certain not to provide samples then the associated instance should be unregistered.  Sensors are encouraged to publish a new sample whenever a new observation is made even when the same value is observed.  In this way subscribers are made aware of the timeliness of the observation.",

When the alarm is cancelled the instance should be unregistered.  It's still an open question whether alarm samples should be published at regular intervals during the alarm condition.
